<p><b>Aquarium</b> projects based on Computer Graphics using openGL,Computer graphics today is largely interactive.The user controls the contents, structure, and 
    appearance of the objects and of their displayed images by using input devices, such as keyboard, 
    mouse, or touch-sensitive panel on the screen. Because of the close relationship between the 
    input devices and the display, the handling of such devices is included in the study of computer 
    graphics.The main idea behind this project is to display an aquarium with computer graphics. This 
    graphics package is based on the OpenGL library functions. The programming language used here is C
    using OpenGL libraries. In this project, we are demonstrating the screensaver in which the fishes will 
    have a random motion, and the speed of the fish increases with the pressing of the “F” button and decreases 
    with the pressing of the “S” button.</p>
